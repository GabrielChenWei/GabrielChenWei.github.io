	<details><summary class="highlight">Show Answer</summary>
		Explanation: Within the public hospitals, patients have a choice of the different types of ward accommodations on their admission, and subsidies provided differ according to the ward class. The wards with basic amenities like C class wards are heavily subsidised up to 80% while B2 wards are subsidized from 25-65%. Those who desire more amenities can choose a higher ward class but will receive less subsidies. Class B1 admissions are subsidized at 20%, while there is no subsidy for Class A ward admissions. However, patients will receive up to 80% in subsidies regardless of whether they are admitted to B2 or C class wards from the middle of 2022.
